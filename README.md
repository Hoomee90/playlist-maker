3. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "PlaylistMaker".
4. Within that directory, create a file called `appsettings.json`
5. In `appsettings.json`, paste the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL.
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=playlist_maker;uid=YOUR_USERNAME;pwd=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
  }
}
```
6. To create the database, execute `dotnet ef database update` in the command line (still in the production directory)
7. Now run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the application. Then navigate to https://localhost:5001.
